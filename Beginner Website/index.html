        <p> I have experience in making websites and currently, focusing on making small portfolios and working on building experience. I also have been taking the time to learn about how to use the Unreal game engine to make my own game at some point. Which is where my art efforts come from, learning how to make a proper landscape and character to fit the story.</p>
